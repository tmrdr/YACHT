  <h3>From Wikipedia:</h3>
  <p>
    Yacht is a public domain dice game, similar to the Latin American game Generala, the English game of Poker Dice, the Scandinavian Yatzy, and Cheerio. Yacht dates back to at least 1938. Yahtzee is a later development, similar to Yacht in both name and content.

  <p id="rules">The objective of the game is to get the highest score possible by rolling five dice each turn.
  <br><br> Points are awarded at the end of the turn based on how many of the dice have the same value and adding their sums.
  <br><br> Each turn cosists of three rolls where the player can hold any dice they have rolled to be used for the next roll.
  <br><br> Once all three rolls have been used, the player must pick a value on the scorecard and will recieve the points shown for that turn.
  <br><br> Once a value on the scorecard has been chosen, it cannot be used again for the rest of the game.
  <br><br> The game ends when all of the available values on the scorecard have been used and the player's final score is the sum of all of the values chosen.</p>
